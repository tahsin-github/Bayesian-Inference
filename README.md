Estimation of the effects of physiological attributes on Cardiovascular Disease: Bayesian Logistic Regression.

The aim of this project is to estimate effects of important physiological attributes on cardiovascular disease. 
There are 13 important attributes considered for the analysis. The Bayesian Logistic Regression was used to 
estimate the model parameters. To estimate the model parameters normal prior was used. The results suggested
varying effects of the attributes on cardiovascular disease. Also, the effects of the attributes on different 
severity of cardiovascular disease are different.
